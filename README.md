Welcome to the FMM Playground API! This API consists of three main resources: flights, delays, and passengers.

The flights resource allows you to retrieve information about flights, such as flight number, departure and arrival times, and the airports the flight is traveling to and from.

The delays resource provides information about any delays that may have occurred during a flight, including the length of the delay and the reason for the delay.

The passengers resource allows you to retrieve information about the passengers on a flight, such as their name, seat number, and ticket class.

You can use the API to create, read, update, and delete entries in each of these resources, making it easy to manage and track flight data.
